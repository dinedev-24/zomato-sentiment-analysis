The seasoning given alongside goes well with the wraps, 'RATED\n  I ordered from the Navratra Menu during Navratri this month. Out of the wide variety offered I ordered the Sabudana Vada and Curd meal and Kuttu Aloo Parantha with Paneer Makhanwala Royal Meal.\n\nThe Sabudana Vada was perfectly made and was a great light meal paired with curd. The Kutti Aloo Paratha and Paneer Makhanwala Royal Meal was a great combination. Making aloo paratha with Kuttu is a great idea and it tasted amazing.

The order which we gave got messed up very badly. We ordered Egg biryani and ended up getting chicken pieces(4-5). If you are a vegetarian don\'t go to this place they will serve you chicken rice for veg biryani and egg biryani. And another of my friend went there and ordered Egg biryaani bcoz he does not eat chicken but found 4-5 pieces of chicken in his biryani.

Food quality is average and the meat used looked frozen which made the taste horrible and just seemed that it was coated by a lot of south Indian spices and curry leaves which didn't seem pleasant. Next time I should definitely think before ordering as even the min order is high and I guess they have just created a brand but not a name. Very disappointed."""")",Negative,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,

" """"RATED\n  A great hang out option right in the heart of Jaynagar ...it's a delightful tea lovers..I had the kashmiri kahwa after I first tried it in Leh. The restaurant is very aesthetically designed. They have different seating options including a julha. Suggest you book in advance and go. The food options are also plenty but pure vegetarian. Service is prompt . Visit tea villa for a good meal. Pricing is on the higher side."""")", if you've been to Pondicherry you would know this. They have seperate Menu Book for Food and a separate Menu book for teas and they've about 300 flavours of Teas available. We ordered a Chilly Cheese Toast and Mixed Fruit Waffle," chilly cheese toast. Chilly Cheese Toast was absolutely lip smacking\U0001f929 and we ate all of them in the next 5 mins. Wasn't really impressed with the presentation of the Waffles as I'm used to having high quality Belgium Waffles and have tried many flavours. But wanna come down again to try some more stuff on an ordinary day to avoid the waiting time. You need to find a place to park your vehicle here and table booking is recommended.  """")", 'RATED\n  Found this place at the corner of jayanagar. There are such places which gives me a cozy and positivw vibe when i see it. This is one of those places. Loved the ambience. I loved how they focus on spreading the essence of tea with their several attractive flavours and most of all good for health and your body. I mostly loved the place for its calm and energising aroma and lighting. I sat on the balcony with my best friend Nikita Shukla and spending the first day of the year of 2019 made it even more special. A great place to have conversations with your loved ones over a tea, ('Rated 4.0'," """"RATED\n \nThis place is Located in the corner of the Road where Mayyas Restaurant is present.

 'RATED\n  I feel it is a bit of hype and overpriced. Maybe I expected more. Went there with family and friends for a lunch buffet which was booked through Zomato app. They claim to be Goan.

I expected a Xacuti or a Vindaloo or a Balchao or a Sorpotel or a Cafreal or a Recheado. There was none. Probably that was the reason for disappointment.

I thought it would be just a mistake of one off staff so today went again and told them that last time it was not good exp. This time also when i ordered mutton biryani family pack. Was surprised to see only 4 small pieces of mutton in a family pack even after telling them last exp. Totally fool they are making.

 but my nonvegetarian friends ordered thai for first time and they loved it alot. The options are yummy and quite cost friends. So I ordered Mediterranean sizzler and spring roll. The bill was 1000 RS for 5 people.\n\nAlthough a rating less because we were kicked out for playing games loudly :/'), it didn't even falter for a min in spite of such heavy rush. Ordered a number of dishes. The drinks were soooo refreshing and delicious. The corn crushed chicken timder were absolutely scrumptious. The spicy roast chilli lamb was beautifully prepared and tasted great. For mains, had three black pepper chicken with noodles. It comes in a hot sizzling bowl where the contents are mixed by the staff. It was mouth watering with perfect flavour. And to finish our dinner," it was amazing. A must visit place for all the lovers of Asian food and for others too."""")", ('Rated 5.0'," """"RATED\n  The restaurant has decent sitting capacity and the view is just wow. The music is good. They offer a wide variety of Asian food ranging from starters and noodles and rice along with some drinks and shakes. The staff is courteous.

Usually places that charge exorbitant prices for the usual food items offer food of superior quality! But that is not the case here at Kailash Parbat. This is my second such experience. The veg Thali came at a high price ( of course!) But quantity wise it was decent. The food definitely looks good but it fails to blow your mind in terms of taste.\nThe rice that came with the combo was extremely bland. It felt like they just mixed vegetables and cooked rice for the heck of it! The saving grace of the whole meal was the dal and the Boondi raita. The Chana and Paneer weren't impressive either. The size of the gulab jamun that came in this meal was the size of a pebble.\nThe only other refreshing part of the meal was the buttermilk. Nice consistency and satisfactory taste.\n\nPaisa Vasool?

The ambience is very down to earth and normal. The service is mixed. The owner and some waiters are very friendly while some are not. Also food is very economical. My most regular gastronomic haunt in Bangalore.'),beef fry," steamed fish... Make u say wow....and yammy.. It's good for guys and gals which will not make u miss Kerala food in Bangalore... There is one guy thr who provides u the menu and style its cooked...on which u can choose....\n\nTry having kappa with crab curry its awesome better than the combination of meen curry...\n\nIf u like crab alone ask then to provide only crabs with no gravy in it ... Crabs cooked here is dam awesome...\n\nTry having kappa with crab curry you will enjoy it....."""")", 'RATED\n  Amazing home made food feel :)\n\nAmbiance is bit boring as lot of customers just flood in but in case if you are looking for Authentic Kerala Food, ('Rated 3.5'," """"RATED\n  A very good small restaurant which is of Kerala style ...

Service has always been pretty good. Regarding ambience"," the chutney provided really brings the best out of it ! Chinese food is worth mentioning too. We did try the caramel ice-cream dessert. Which was the only disappointing meal so far. Overall a must try restaurant especially during a major sporting event :D\n\nRating out of 10\nFood - 9\nService - 9\nAmbience - 7\nValue for money - 8\nHygeine - 8\n\nTip: They do add a hefty 10% service charge.

No matter the order took a little time to come as it was full with capacity but the taste and presentation of the items were great and very filling . Breads were soft and the curry was sufficient for 2 and even 3 if in a group.. The prices were fair and the service was good . Management can plan something in terms of some more pleasant music to make this outlet one of the best one .'), 'RATED\n  Superb place . Their Biriyani is simply great .

There are are many good malayali restaurant in bangalore. In any of the hotel if we order rice they give as much we want and we will be satisfied .But this guys charge extra for getting more  rice.They don't even supply curries. and the reason they say is that they need to serve it to others also.Are they doing charity or what.And believe me don't buy any side dishes from this restaurant.They are serving the old food which has been kept in freezers for long days.and they serve till it finishes.Fish items and vegitable  items are rotten ones too.Also they are pricing it very high which is not at all affordable.So guys please avoid going to this restaurant.Also be aware of the the guy without hair serving there.He is fraud ", 'RATED\n  Poor food quality.

With right amount of spices n spring onions n chillies.\n\nDouble chocolate shake was my favourite drink compared to peanut butter and strawberry shake. While ordering the peanut butter and strawberry shake we were so very skeptical thinking how's this gonna blend together. It was nice except the cream topping. More of peanut butter taste than the strawberry.\n\nAnd coming to the double decker beef burger was little dissappointed since it didn't look even close to the photos in menu card. And the beef patty was overloaded with a flavored leave. It completely missed the fresh lettuce leaves. Still I would say the burger is above 3.5/5\n\nOverall a great place to be.

Got really crowded on a Sunday evening.Parking got messy with too many cars.Have to remove several cars to remove one car.The tables were not very clean tats mayb cause they were antique furnitures and difficult to make it sparking clean as the spilled food gets stuck in the crevices.Over all 3/5 for us but definetely 5/5 for a pure vegetarian try out which is wide with options'), ('Rated 5.0', ('Rated 5.0', different theme, creative menu,Positive,Positive,Neutral,Positive,

Service is also poor and they took 30 mins for one of the dish when I stayed here (in their hotel).

" """"RATED\n  The only advantage this restaurant have is that they donot have any big competitor nearby to them for North Indian Cuisine. Ordered Dum ka Chicken through Food Panda and it was a pickup from us as the restaurant is very nearby to our place.They have good seating arrangement and is covered in large area. But food was pathetic. The gravy was raw and i could feel the raw Garlic pieces in every bite. The Masala was not at all cooked properly and gravy portion was very less sufficient only for a person and if you are having rice with that then forget it even for a person . Now coming to Chicken. There was only 1 big piece"," """"RATED\n  Ordered food from this eatery through Swiggy. The whole idea was to try from a place which was new to us and we were disappointed big time. The quality and the quantity can't be justified. The biryani was on spicer side. The description of the food no where  matched what we received. The quality of the rice used is almost equivalent to a road side dhaba", a close up of the biryani is also attached here from which the statement can be verified. The only goods were the 1) Raita which was pretty good and 2) the delivery which was taken care by Swiggy.  So all in all if one wants to have a good raita for two, ('Rated 5.0'," 1 medium size piece and 3 very small boneless pieces.The biggest piece was hard and very chewy. None of the piece had any flavour. Looks like they just dip the chicken as per order and  don't cook it at all.\nOverall a bad experience from this place. May be i will try again to judge them for other dishes too."""")", ('Rated 2.0',Positive,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,

Ended the meal with Cocolime which was very refreshing.\nThe service is nice and prompt and cordial.\nPrice is little on the higher side but @zomatogold was a saviour.

There only disappointment is that they don't offer many dishes in the menu- I'm longing to have all those authentic dishes like meen pathiri , ('Rated 3.5', 'RATED\n  Both the number listed are not reachable...this gives the impression that the restaurant is no longer in service....you should remove this listing'), ('Rated 3.5',Positive,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,

You will never get disappointed with all the items in their menu. They have a very less variety in menu with good good options. You can get indian, Chinese and European options here including some kerala delicacies.\n\nWe ordered tandoori chicken and fish n chips as starter. Both were awesome. Succulent pieces of tandoori chicken with crispy fried fish increased our appetite. Main course we had prawn masala and kadhai chicken with couple of naans and kulcha. Thoroughly we enjoyed our time.\n\nService was on its top notch. Staffs are well behaved and friendly.

 'RATED\n  Found this place at the corner of jayanagar. There are such places which gives me a cozy and positivw vibe when i see it. This is one of those places. Loved the ambience. I loved how they focus on spreading the essence of tea with their several attractive flavours and most of all good for health and your body. I mostly loved the place for its calm and energising aroma and lighting. I sat on the balcony with my best friend Nikita Shukla and spending the first day of the year of 2019 made it even more special. A great place to have conversations with your loved ones over a tea, ('Rated 4.0', 'RATED\n  Good place for hanging out? I loved the waffles there and I would eat them day and night \U0001f973 wish I could taste all the different kinds of dishes and capture all of them in my camera roll \U0001f92a they have approximately 300 or more tea to taste as am not a tea lover i never ordered for it.

We ordered an amazing beef steak which was perfectly made and couldn't stop eating it the moment I took the first bite. Their white chicken penne pasta was also very good but not as good as the steak. These guys also keep you busy as you wait for your orders to arrive by a fun activity to make your own brushetta. They give you all the ingredients and instructions to make a brushetta own your own.\nEven thought it's slightly on the pricey end it won't hurt to try it out once in a while.
